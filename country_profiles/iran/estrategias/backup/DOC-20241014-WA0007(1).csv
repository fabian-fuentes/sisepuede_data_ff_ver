Reduce excess fertilizer use,TX:SOIL:DEC_N_APPLIED,"Use of fertilizer in agriculture is the primary source of anthropogenic nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions (Tian et al., 2020). Global overuse and misapplication of N2O is a significant and avoidable contributor to these emissions (McKinsey et al., 2020). This strategy targets applying excess nitrogen (i.e., the amount of fertilizer that can be reduced without affecting yield), which is highest in countries such as China and India that subsidize fertilizer use but is also significant in Latin America (West et al., 2017). Table X.2 specifies per-hectare nitrogen (N) input that is not taken up by harvested crops, of which 10-30% could be avoided without an impact on yield.","Any fertilizer historically applied beyond the benefits it yields is avoided.

Expand conservation agriculture,TX:AGRC:INC_CONSERVATION_AGRICULTURE,"Conservation agriculture is the term given to agricultural practices that seek to preserve soil and ecosystem health. FAO describes three inter-related practices: minimum tilling, maintaining permanent soil cover, and diversifying plant species (FAO, 2022). While Latin America is already a leader in no-till practices (McKinsey et al., 2020; Kassam et al., 2019; Sperow, 2020), there is room for improving these practices’ extent and scope, particularly given the poor quality of some current efforts (Kassam, 2019).","High-quality conservation agricultural practices are expanded to 80% of crop land on which grains and staples are grown, excluding rice (which is addressed in the next transformation)."
Improve rice management,TX:AGRC:DEC_CH4_RICE,"Many practices can reduce emissions associated with growing rice, including improved water management, fertilizer practices, tillage practices, rice variety choices, residue management, and seeding practices (McKinsey et al., 2020; Chirinda et al., 2018).",All rice growing is transitioned to these improved practices.

Reducing food losses and waste in the supply chain,TX:AGRC:DEC_LOSSES_SUPPLY_CHAIN,"Food waste and loss is a massive economic cost to LAC and globally (Hanson et al., 2022; Flanagan et al., 2019).
